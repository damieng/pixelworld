Bitmap font conversion and manipulation tools

This is a tool I have been using for a number of years to convert my own fonts as well as look into bulk-ripping pixel fonts from old video games.

The code isn't great, it's pretty crufty in a lot of places but it's about time I opened up the repo in case anyone else finds it useful.
